<h3>(in my opinion)</h3>
<hr>
<h2>US by Jordan Peele</h2>
    <p>This psychological horror follows the story of Adelaide Wilson and her family, who are attacked by a group of doppelgangers, later announced as "Tethered". Words cannot describe the creepiness and tension that follows this family, chaos seems to be around every corner.</p>
    <p>A highly recommended watch if you need something that keeps you on edge and shocks you with each plot twist it throws at you.</p>

<h2>Vivarium by Lorcan Finnegan</h2>
    <p>Now this, will blow your mind. In the sense of completely confusing the fuck out of you for the first hour. It follows the story of a couple who are forced to care for a mysterious humanoid creature while trapped in a strange, vivarium-like neighbourhood. Each house is a perfect mimic of one-another. Attempting to leave said house would awaken a problem for this couple.</p>
    <p>Make sure you are fully awake for this one, many things happen within the span of an hour and it'd be a shame if you missed any of it.</p>
    
<h2>The Silence Of The Lambs by Jonathan Demme</h2>
    <p>this absolute masterpiece created back in 1991 follows the story if Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee who is hunting a serial killer named "Buffalo Bill", who skins his female victims. To catch him, she seeks the advice of the imprisoned Hannibal Lector, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer.</p>
