<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi my name is Chloe and I'm a self taught Software Developer student.</p>
<p>I've been in the work force since 2018 in retail, and since 2022 in Media and Content Production by my own Twitch & Youtube channels.</p>
<p>I've attended TAFE a number of times always in IT fields and have decided to commit myself to full time studying with the help of professional software engineering mentors, bootcamps, udemy and crash courses.</p>
<p>Through my time in IT studying i've learnt a little C# and Python, these days im focussing on Javascript and Typescript for my educational needs.</p>
